# FFX Battle Opcode Reference & Modding Guides

This repository is a centralized **information and tutorial hub** for understanding, analyzing, and modifying **Final Fantasy X’s battle system opcodes**, with a strong focus on **monster AI logic and decision-making**.
---

This repository is aimed at:
- FFX modders and reverse engineers
- Anyone interested in how Final Fantasy X’s battle logic actually works

No prior knowledge of FFX opcode internals is required, but familiarity with basic programming concepts (conditions, variables, logic operators) will be helpful.

## How to Use This Repository

You can approach this repository in two ways:

### As a Reference
Use this as a lookup for:
- Battle opcodes and their functions
- Conditional checks and comparisons
- Targeting rules and selectors
- Variable assignments and battle state queries

### As a Tutorial
Follow the examples and explanations to learn:
- How monster AI evaluates battle conditions
- How decision logic is constructed
- How raw opcode sequences translate into readable behavior
- How to safely modify or design new AI routines

Examples are intentionally written using **real FFX opcode data** to reflect how the engine behaves in practice.
