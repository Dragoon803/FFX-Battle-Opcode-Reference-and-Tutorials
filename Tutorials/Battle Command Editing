This tutorial is intended to help you make modifications to FFX's battle commands.
This includes editing command names, descriptions, and characteristics.

You will need:
  -A basic understanding of hexidecimal and bytes
  -Programmer calculator
  -command.bin file
  -item.bin file
  -monmagic1.bin file
  -monmagic2.bin file
  -ImHex with the ffx_en.tbl 
  -FFXProjectEditor

If you don't have the ffx_en.tbl here is a link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GwI3gqPU2nEN3zpdaHCneph4JbkAnfBu/view?usp=drive_link
This file translates the hex values found in the battle command files into readable english.


Changing Characteristics of Commands/Items/Monster Commands
  Changing commands characteristics is super simple thanks to the FFXProjectEditor.
  Open the FFXProjectEditor and load your master folder.
  Click the Battle tab then the file you want to edit.
  There are multiple check boxes at the top that contain the characteristics of the command.
  Check the box you want to make the edits under.
  Example: If I want Dark Attack to last 6 turns instead of 3 I'd check the Status box, locate the column to the right of Darkness and then change the 3 to a 6.
  Save your changes then run your mod and test the result.

Once you understand the concepts below you can make the same changes to the other battle command bin files. 
For the sake of brevity I will only be talking about the command.bin.


Name and Description Chunk Locations Within the Command Structure
  Each command is a 96 byte structure.         *Note: monmagic commands have a 92 byte structure.*
  Within each command structure there are 2 sets of 2 byte chunks that correspond to the name and description of the command.
  The name chunk is bytes 0 and 1.
  The description chunk is bytes 8 and 9.
  These chunks tell the command what byte to begin reading relative to the offset the text structure begins at.
  Example: the Attack command has [09 00] for it's description. If we go to offset: 0x7814 and count the proceeding bytes from 0 to 9 we arrive at the Attack description.
  Byte reading ends when the line reaches a 0x00.
  The first command begins at offset: 0x14
  

Finding Specific Command Names and Descriptions
  To locate the exact offset where the command name or description is located you just need to do simple math.
  Take the starting offset: 0x7814 and add the hex value located in the command's name chunk or description chunk.
  Example: The second command starts at offset: 0x74 where we find the name chunk of [31 00]. So 0x7814 + 0x31 = 0x7845.
  This sum is the offset we need to go to. 
  At offset: 0x7845 we find [58 83 74 7C] which if you are using the ffx_en.tbl should read as Item. 
  So we know that the second command in the command.bin is the command Item.
  
  
Changing Command Names or Descriptions
  Simply find the start location of the name or description in ImHex and edit the bytes using the FFX Text Encoding Table provided at the bottom of this tutorial.
  You can check your changes by opening the edited file in the FFXProjectEditor.
  
  
Adding Additional Text
  If a description or name is too short or if you want to edit the EXTRA commands and give them descriptions here is what you do.
  Scroll to the very bottom of the bin file you want to edit in ImHex.
  Right click the final byte. 
  Click the insert mode Option.
  Begin adding the text you want. 
  When finished make sure to end the line with 00.         *Note: If you forget to do this the file will crash.*
  Then subtract the offset where your new text begins from the offset where the names and descriptions structure start.
  Example: 0xAE24(my new text) - 0x7814 (text structure begins) = 3610 or [10 36]
  This is not an offset, but a value for the Name or Description chunk.
  Input your new value into the appropriate chunk and save the file.
  Then open the file in FFXProjectEditor to see how the change effected it.
