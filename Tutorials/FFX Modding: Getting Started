This tutorial is intended to help you get set up to mod FFX.
There are several tools and files you will need. This tutorial also assumes that you have your own copy of FFX.

1) A copy of the extracted game files. 
Within FFX's game files there is a folder named data. Inside this folder is the FFX_Data.vbf. This is where we will extract our files from.
Download the VBF Browser here: https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy12/mods/3
Both FFXII and FFX use vbf files. this program can be used for both games.
Once downloaded run the VBF Browser. 
Click OPEN and locate the FFX_data.vbf file. Location should look similar to this: SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/FINAL FANTASY FFX&FFX-2 HD Remaster/data.
Once the vbf file loads select ffx_ps2 in the right hand window then click extract. Extract your game files wherever you'd like.
It is recommended that you keep an unedited version of the extracted game files somewhere on your computer as a backup.
Once you've got the files extracted we're done with step 1.
  
2) Obtaining an FFX Mod Loader.
There are two solid options for loading FFX mods. The FFX and X-2 HD External File Loader by FFGriever and Fahrenheit.

	FFX External File Loader
EFL is a simple file loader that lets you load your edited game files instead of the original game files. 
This lets you make edits without worrying about corrupting or breaking your base game.

	Fahrenheit
Fahrenheit is a much more customizable program that allows you to load external files and make edits to the games engine by hooking into the games internal functions. This will require knowledge of C# programming.
If you are looking to make major changes to FFX such as changing damage formulas, adding bonus damage to certain moves etc then Fahrenheit is what you want.
Fahreheit is a bit of a beast to setup so it is recommended that you carefully follow the github instructions. If you run into problems join the Cid's Salvage Ship discord. We will gladly help you with setup.

Other useful tools:

  ImHex
A very in-depth hex editor. It comes with hexpat files specifically built to breakdown the internal structures within certain FFX files. It is a very useful tool and highly recommended.

	FFXDataParser by Karifean
This program translates the hex data within FFX game files and outputs them into human readable text. Can be a tad difficult to setup, but well worth the effort.

You can also find already parsed data files in our Discord.

	FFXProjectEditor by Osdanova.
A program designed to edit various aspects of FFX including: monster properties, items, commands, monster commands, etc. Another highly recommended tool.

The github has setup & how to use instructions.
